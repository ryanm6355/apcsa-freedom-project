# Ghost Defense
by Ryan Mayleas

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for APCSA is all about seeing what SEP students are able to make when they learn by themselves. The purpose of this blog is for myself to process how I made my project and what I can learn from it.

## Content
For my project, I am making a Top Down 2D arcade game about a man trying to shoot 3 ghosts and a bunch of slimes. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Unity in order to make Ghost Defense.

## Implications
This project could help bring people together to see each other try to get the highest score.
