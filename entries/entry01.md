For my freedom project,I've decided that I would be using Unity and I would be making a top-down 2d adventure game akin to the first Zelda game.The reason I wanted to use Unity was for just how prolific it is in the game dev world currently and I figured that this was the best opportunity to learn it.

Links to tools that I considered:</br>
[Unity](https://unity.com/)</br>
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
