For my freedom project,I've decided that I would be using Unity and I would be making a top-down 2d adventure game akin to the first Zelda game.The reason I wanted to use Unity was for just how prolific it is in the game dev world currently and I figured that this was the best opportunity to learn it.I was initially going to learn 3d,but I wanted to do something smaller since Unity is a whole new experience for me.I had to learn about how I was going to approach Unity(How to learn) and how I was going to schedule the time in which I work on my project(Time Management).Currently I'm on step 4 of the Engineering Design Process(Planning the most prominent solution) and will hopefully move on to step 5(Creating a prototype).
