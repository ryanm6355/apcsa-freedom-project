After I finally picked out Unity as my language of choice for the freedom project, I now had to see how I was going to go through learning about Unity.

Right away, the Unity's "Learn" website had already given a provided plan for getting started via the Essentials Pathway. With it, I was able to understand how to install Unity and understand how to use the editor's menu. The pathway then suggested that I should try out what Unity calls their "microgames". I tried the FPS microgame and it gave me a good idea of things like how to move your viewpoint around, how to edit the scene to include more or less objects, and how to edit components and their variables.

After finishing the microgame, I felt confident enough to learn outside of the pathway and decided to find a beginners' project to learn from. I eventually stumbled upon "Ruby's Adventure", a project about making a 2d adventure game like some of the early Zelda games. As mentioned in my first blog, I had the plans to make a game of a similar genre, so this seemed right up my alley (of course, I was only learning from Ruby's Adventure and not just finishing it and then submitting for the Freedom Project).

When first starting up Ruby, I had to download an earlier version of Unity because it wasn't compatible with the latest version I already had. After that, it seemed like smooth sailing. I was learning how to set up folders for objects such as characters sprites and tiles, I was learning how to import assets to put in the game, and I even made my first scripture to allow for moving the main character around. Things were going great until it asked to put in a tile.

The instructions had said that to add tiles, I simply had to click on the plus sign and then click on tile, but the editor instead had something called tilemap in place of tile. When I asked online, people had just said that all I had to do was make a tilemap then drag in an image to use as a tile palette, but I just couldn't figure out how to do that. I then downloaded an even earlier version of unity, but Ruby only allowed for the latest version it was compatible with, and so I've just been stuck and unable to progress in the project (I've been trying to learn C# for the scriputres though).

During the winter break, I hope to either find the right way to finally fix Ruby or at least find a different project that I can work on. On the engineering design process,I'm still on planning out the program and hope that I'll finally finish Ruby's Adventure so I can move onto creating the prototype for my program. I feel like this whole experience has helped me realize the importance of knowing how to learn and the importance of organzing your plan because I didn't read through what you needed for Ruby's Adventure and I'm struggling with learning Unity because of it.
