When I made my last blog, I was in the process of making my Minimum Viable Project for the Freedom Project. Over the spring break, I had worked on my MVP and polished it up,and now I can say that I'm officially finished with my MVP.

To finish it all up, I had simply took what information I had learnt from the first tutorial video I watched and then tried to apply it to what I had wanted for my game.Whenever I didn't know how to do something and the video couldn't help me, I either turned to Unity's official documentation or ask people online for help on Unity's Discord Server. When I was finished with the game initially, I took it to my mom and my brother for them to test it out and they gave me ways to make the game better. After the testing, I ended up adding sound and mechanics made to make the game harder. Overall, after the progress nd struggles I've made on this, I'm really glad about how the project turned out.  
During the time I've worked on this project, I've been on the stages of creating a prototype and testing and evaluating the prototype in the engineering design process. Now I have to move onto the next stage and improve the prototype in ways that are necessary.  
I feel like between the last blog and this blog, I've developed my skills in collaboration because I've had to ask people on the discord server for help on my project and I've asked my brother and mother to test out my project and give me feedback. I also feel like I've developed my skills in embracing failure because, for example, when I had trouble with trying to make game objects only collide with certain other game objects, it gave me the opportunity to learn about the "layer collision matrix", which would allow me to decide what colliders are allowed to collide with depending on what layer their in. So essentially, I learnt how to embrace failure by using it as an opportunity to learn about Unity.
