During the time I've worked on this project, I've been on the stages of creating a prototype and testing and evaluating the prototype in the engineering design process. Now I have to move onto the next stage and improve the prototype in ways that are necessary.  
I feel like between the last blog and this blog, I've developed my skills in collaboration because I've had to ask people on the discord server for help on my project and I've asked my brother and mother to test out my project and give me feedback. I also feel like I've developed my skills in embracing failure because, for example, when I had a
