# Entry 6
##### 6/3/23

In my last entry I had finished up my MVP, after that, I now had to present the MVP.  
The first time I had to present was in class. After last year where I had stumbled in presenting because I had improvised what I was saying but didn't think properly and after I presented for the showcase amazingly by preparing with index cards, I had decided that I was gonna do the same thing I did for the showcase with the index cards again. Ultimately, I ended up doing an amazing job with the presentation and even got a perfect score on it. I was able to fit in the necessary details for the slides without being overtly long and make the slides look visually appealing. Mr. Mueller even got everyone in the class to play my game...in which some kids found some ways to exploit the game.  
The second and last time I had to present for the expo.I didn't get picked for the showcase,unfortunately.For the expo, a lot of people came up to hear me pitch my game and all of them were very impressed. Surprisingly, nobody who tried the game was able to find the exploits. I was very proud of myself for how that turned out, although I do feel like I could have done better in speaking out loud.  
I feel as though these presentations have helped me develop in organization, in that I used index cards while presenting to organize my thoughts, and attention to detail, in that I made sure I didn't include too much detail for my slides. I've completed the last step of the Engineering Design Process of "Communicating the results" and so now I've fully completed the Freedom Project as a whole.
