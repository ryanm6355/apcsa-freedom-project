When I wrote my last blog, I mentioned how I had stopped following a tutorial because it was too frustrating.After I wrote that blog, I went searching for other tutorials I could follow and even asked a classmate on videos I should watch.Before I watched any new videos,I came across another unity video by GameMaker's ToolKit,the same channel that made the first tutorial I watched.  
The video was called "How I learned unity without following tutorials" and what I took away from the video is that I should just learn the basics, try to repeat what I learnt by doing things like recreating games I know with Unity, and expermientation.Since I felt like I had done the first two steps already, I decided to stop looking for tutorials and start working on my project. So far, I can actually say I got a fair amount of progress into the project.
