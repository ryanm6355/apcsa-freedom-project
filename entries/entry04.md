When I wrote my last blog, I mentioned how I had stopped following a tutorial because it was too frustrating.After I wrote that blog, I went searching for other tutorials I could follow and even asked a classmate on videos I should watch.Before I watched any new videos,I came across another unity video by GameMaker's ToolKit,the same channel that made the first tutorial I watched.
