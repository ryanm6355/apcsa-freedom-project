When I wrote my last blog, I mentioned how I had stopped following a tutorial because it was too frustrating.After I wrote that blog, I went searching for other tutorials I could follow and even asked a classmate on videos I should watch.Before I watched any new videos,I came across another unity video by GameMaker's ToolKit,the same channel that made the first tutorial I watched.  
The video was called "How I learned unity without following tutorials" and what I took away from the video is that I should just learn the basics, try to repeat what I learnt by doing things like recreating games I know with Unity, and expermientation.Since I felt like I had done the first two steps already, I decided to stop looking for tutorials and start working on my project. So far, I can actually say I got a fair amount of progress into the project.

With the knowledge I gained from the videos I watched, I was able to get my player to move and create the project's tilemap.I also went back to the Ruby's adventure tutorial and skipped the part about tiles to see if it could help me in other ways. I was pleasently surprised at how I used it to learn how to move the player's rigidbody along with the player and how to get enemies to move by themselves.
