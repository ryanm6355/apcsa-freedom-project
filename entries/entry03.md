After things didn't work out with Ruby's Adventure, I decided to look for other tutorials I could use for learning Unity. The first one I found came from the youtube channel, Game Maker's Toolkit, which was meant for complete beginners. The video involved making a flappy bird clone and introduced me to concepts in Unity like Game Objects,Components, and Applying Scripts to Game Objects. The video even encouraged me to make some other stuff with the program by myelf in which I did by adding sound and making it so you die from flying too low or too high.Pictured below is the program I made from the tutorial inside the IDE.

The tutorial I decided to follow afterwards was also meant for beginners but it was also made for the genre I had in mind for the freedom project (Top Down 2D Action). I had learnt from there about how to use tilemaps, make animations, and use Unity's Input System. My main gripe was how the narrator kept making mistakes throughout the video and had to keep correcting himself.There was another video that went into combat that I attempted to follow,but just couldn't. The narrator changed a lot of code from the previous video without explaining much on what to change, the code was getting more and more complicated, and he still kept kept making mistakes. I just got very frustrated and just stopped following it.

After trying out the tutorials, I feel like getting into the step in the Engineering Design Process(EDP) of making a prototype for my project.I plan to use documentation from Unity and ask people online for help on certain parts. I feel like I had developed in knowing How to Learn since before posting this blog as I'm considering what kind of materials I can use to learn Unity and re-evaluating how I should learn Unity. I also feel like I've developed in communication because sometimes the program I'm building has an error and I have to talk with people online to explain what the problem is.
